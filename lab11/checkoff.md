# Exercise 1

* Four floating point divisions in single precision: `__m128 _mm_div_ps (__m128 a, __m128 b)`
* Sixteen max operations over signed 8-bit integers `__m128i _mm_max_epi8 (__m128i a, __m128i b)`
* Arithmetic shift right of eight signed 16-bit integers `__m128i _mm_sra_epi16 (__m128i a, __m128i count)`
